# Project Summary: Customer Segmentation using RFM Technique

## Introduction
In this data project, the aim was to perform customer segmentation using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) technique. 
RFM is a widely used method for analyzing and categorizing customer behavior based on their transaction history. 
By leveraging this technique, we can gain valuable insights into customer segments, their preferences, and their potential value to the business.

The RFM technique evaluates three key dimensions:
- Recency: How recently did the customer make a purchase?
- Frequency: How often does the customer make purchases?
- Monetary: How much does the customer spend on each transaction?

Compared to other segmentation techniques, RFM offers several advantages. It is simple, intuitive, and doesn't require extensive domain knowledge. 
RFM segmentation provides a practical framework to identify distinct customer segments, enabling businesses to tailor their marketing strategies 
and optimize customer experiences effectively.

## Purpose/Objective
The primary purpose of this project is to segment customers based on their RFM scores and identify distinct groups with similar purchasing behaviors. 
By understanding the unique characteristics and preferences of each segment, businesses can personalize marketing campaigns, improve customer retention, 
and maximize revenue opportunities.

## Data Source
The data for this project was sourced from [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00352/Online%20Retail.xlsx]. 
The dataset contains customer transactional information, including purchase dates, order amounts, customer identifiers and more. 
The dataset covers a specific time period, allowing us to analyze recent customer behavior accurately.

## Data Cleaning Process
To prepare the data for analysis, I conducted a comprehensive data cleaning process. Some of the steps involved in this process were:
- Handling missing values;
- Removing duplicates/Data not helpful for analysis
- Converting data to the appropriate data types, etc

## Approaches or Steps to Implementing RFM
To implement the RFM technique, the steps followed the following are as below:

1. Recency Calculation:
   - Determine the reference point: Select the appropriate date as the reference point for calculating recency (e.g., the last available date in the dataset).
   - Calculate recency: For each customer, calculate the number of days between the reference point and their last purchase date.

2. Frequency Calculation:
   - Calculate the number of purchases made by each customer within the defined time period.

3. Monetary Calculation:
   - Calculate the total monetary value spent by each customer over the defined time period.

4. RFM Segmentation:
   - Assign RFM scores to each customer based on their recency, frequency, and monetary values.
   - Segment customers into distinct groups based on their RFM scores, creating segments such as high-value customers, potential churners, and new customers.

## Results
The analysis revealed valuable insights into customer segments and their behaviors. Some of the key findings include:
- Identification of high-value customers who are crucial for revenue generation.
- Discovery of potential churned customers requiring targeted retention strategies
- Continue excellent service, acknowledge loyalty, and offer special rewards for a better customer experience, etc.

Visualizations and detailed metrics supporting these findings can be found in the project's code repository.

## Limitations
It's important to consider the limitations of the project. Some factors to keep in mind include:
- The analysis is based on the available data within the defined time period, and future trends may differ.
- The RFM segmentation model relies on predefined thresholds and assumptions, which may not capture the complexity of individual customer behaviors.

## Future Work
While the project provides valuable insights, there are opportunities for further exploration and enhancement, including:
- Incorporating additional features or external data sources to enrich the RFM analysis.
- Applying machine learning techniques to predict future customer behavior and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.

## Recommendation
Based on our findings and observations, the following points are recommend:
- Implement personalized marketing campaigns for each customer segment, considering their unique characteristics and preferences.
- Devise targeted re-engagement initiatives for potential churned customers to reduce churn rates.
- Continually monitor and refine the segmentation model based on evolving business requirements and changes in customer behavior.
- Regularly update and analyze the RFM scores to accommodate the latest customer transactions and trends.
- Personalize offerings, anticipate needs, and ensure a seamless customer experience to maintain loyalty

By adopting a data-driven approach and implementing these recommendations, the project's outcomes will have a positive impact on the business, 
enabling it to optimize marketing efforts, increase customer satisfaction, and drive revenue growth.
